## PWP Milestone 3 Feedback
Nice work pulling this together in the nick of time! Unfortunately it was still submitted a day late, so this will effect your score. I also see that you're still polishing things up. Overall this is looking nice. I hope this was a beneficial  learning experience - even though I know this project was stressful for you!

Your form appears to be working correctly - check your email to see if you received my test message.

Great job on working with the images... they are all resized well, and are crisp and clear while keeping a small file size.

All minimum requirements have been met - nice work overall. Your Milestone 3 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

Your overall grade across all of your PWP Milestones is 17/40 points (42.5%).

- Milestone 1 - 20%: Tier II 20(0.2) = 4
- Milestone 2a - 20%: Tier I 10(0.2) = 4
- Milestone 2b - 10%: Tier I 10(0.1) = 1
- Milestone 3 - 50%: Tier II 20(0.5) = 10

### Edits &amp; Suggestions Going Forward...
- Change &lt;title&gt; tag text to something more meaningful - Like "D&amp;M Development"
- Consider resizing/repositioning your form buttons and surrounding elements like the output area, etc.
- jQuery is loaded twice - remove the script tag on line 23
- For further styling work, consider adding a stylish font for headings, and a little more color - these two easy things will add a lot of visual impact.
- Consider adding a little more padding between the about sections on the mobile view for more visual consistency.
